            <h2>1. The Startup Costs (2026 Estimates)</h2>
            <p>Office cleaning has the lowest barrier to entry of your four tracks because you don't necessarily need a truck—a reliable car or SUV will work for your first few small offices.</p>

            <h2>2. The "Military Clean" Equipment List</h2>
            <p>For office spaces, the goal is speed and sanitization without disturbing the workspace.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Vacuum:</strong> Invest in a commercial-grade backpack vacuum with a HEPA filter. It allows you to move through cubicles 30% faster than an upright.</li>
                <li><strong>Microfiber System:</strong> Use color-coded cloths (e.g., Red for bathrooms, Blue for desks) to prevent cross-contamination—a key selling point for "Military Clean."</li>
                <li><strong>The Janitor Cart:</strong> A rolling cart keeps all your sprays, bags, and tools organized so you don't have to keep walking back to your car.</li>
                <li><strong>Flat Mop System:</strong> Avoid the old "string mop and bucket" if possible. A flat mop with washable pads is more hygienic and dries faster.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Compliance</h2>
            <p>Some states have a unique requirement for this specific industry that you may need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Janitorial Registration:</strong> Under the Property Service Workers Protection Act, all janitorial employers must register annually with the Labor Commissioner's Office ($500 fee).</li>
                <li><strong>Sexual Harassment Training:</strong> You might need to provide specific in-person training to your cleaning staff every two years.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance &amp; Bonding:</strong> Offices often contain sensitive data. You need a Janitorial Bond (Dishonesty Bond), which protects the client if an employee is accused of theft. This builds immense trust.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Strategic Marketing: Finding "The Anchor"</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medical &amp; Dental Offices:</strong> These are the "Gold Mine." They require high-level sanitization and are willing to pay a premium for a "Military Clean" veteran who understands precision.</li>
                <li><strong>The "After-Hours" Pitch:</strong> Market your reliability. "Our team is background-checked, vetted, and disciplined. We treat your secure office with the same respect as a military installation."</li>
                <li><strong>Property Managers:</strong> Property managers often oversee 10–20 small office buildings. Winning one manager can fill your entire schedule.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Revenue &amp; Pricing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Square Footage:</strong> Most offices are bid between $0.10 and $0.25 per square foot depending on the frequency.</li>
                <li><strong>Hourly Rate:</strong> For smaller offices, aim for $40–$65 per labor hour.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Add-On" Strategy:</strong> Use your other Veteran Enterprise tracks! Once you have the office cleaning contract, you can offer them a quarterly Window Wash or a semi-annual Pressure Wash for their parking lot.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>A Note: The "Silent Professional" Rule</h2>
            <p>In office cleaning, the best service is the one that is never seen. We leave no "cleaning smell" (no harsh bleach), no moved papers, and zero footprints. The only evidence we were there is a spotless environment and a "Mission Accomplished" card left on the front desk.</p>
