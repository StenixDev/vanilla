        </header>

        <section>
            <p>Starting a pressure washing business is a popular way for veterans and entrepreneurs to build a profitable, hands-on service business. Given your experience with "Military Clean" and your background in helping veterans start cleaning businesses, you likely already know that the "barrier to entry" is relatively low, but the "barrier to professional success" depends on having the right gear and legal protections.</p>

            <h2>1. Initial Startup Costs (2026 Estimates)</h2>
            <p>You can start lean or go "pro" from day one. Here is the breakdown:</p>

            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Tier</th>
                            <th>Estimated Cost</th>

                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Lean Startup</td>
                            <td>$2,000 – $4,500</td>
                            <td>Mid-range gas pressure washer (4 GPM), basic hoses, nozzles, and essential marketing (flyers/business cards).</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Professional</td>
                            <td>$6,000 – $15,000</td>
                            <td>High-grade commercial unit, surface cleaner attachment, professional insurance, LLC filing, and a small trailer.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Fully Loaded</td>

                            <td>Custom truck/van mount, hot water unit (for grease/oil), large water tanks, and a robust digital marketing budget.</td>

            <h2>2. Essential Equipment List</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Machine:</strong> Aim for at least 4 Gallons Per Minute (GPM). PSI is important, but GPM is what actually moves the dirt and saves you time.</li>
                <li><strong>Surface Cleaner:</strong> This is a "must-have" for driveways. It cleans 4x faster than a wand and leaves a streak-free finish.</li>
                <li><strong>Hoses:</strong> You'll need a high-pressure hose (at least 100-200 feet) and a heavy-duty garden hose to reach the customer's spigot.</li>
                <li><strong>Nozzles:</strong> A set of color-coded tips (0°, 15°, 25°, 40°) for different surfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemicals:</strong> Biodegradable soaps and surfactants. In California, using "green" chemicals is a strong selling point.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Legal &amp; Compliance</h2>
            <p>Operating in many counties requires a few extra steps to stay on the right side of the law:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contractor's License:</strong> You may need a C-61/D-38 (Sand and Water Blasting) contractor's license.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Permits:</strong> Many counties also prohibit sending soapy "wash water" into storm drains. You may need a reclaim system or "booms" to divert water to landscaped areas where it can soak into the ground.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> General Liability Insurance is non-negotiable. It protects you if you accidentally strip the paint off a house or if someone slips on a wet driveway. Expect to pay $500 – $1,500 per year.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. How to Get Your First 5 Clients</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Google Business Profile:</strong> This is free and essential. When people in Vista search "pressure washing near me," you want your name to pop up with 5-star reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Before &amp; After" Trap:</strong> Take photos of every job. Nothing sells a cleaning service better than a photo of a half-clean, half-dirty driveway.</li>
                <li><strong>Nextdoor &amp; Facebook:</strong> Join community groups. Offer a "Veteran-Owned" discount to build initial traction.</li>
                <li><strong>Lawn Care Partners:</strong> Talk to local landscapers. They do the grass; you do the patio. It's a perfect referral loop.</li>
